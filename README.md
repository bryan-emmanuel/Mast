Mast allows browsing and casting videos over HTTP.

Copy the www/mast.py file to your webserver in the same directory as the videos.

Note: the videos need to be in a format supported by Chromecast
https://developers.google.com/cast/supported_media_types

In the app settings, provide the URL for the directory containing the videos
and the mast.py file. If no protocol is specified, http is used by default

Movie Covers:

Covers are supported, and should be jpg's, measuring 200x300 pixels.

For an individual video, use the same name but with a jpg extension:
/Movie.mp4
/Movie.jpg

For a directory of videos, use cover.jpg:
/Season 1/cover.jpg
